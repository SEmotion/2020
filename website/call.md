## Motivation

Affective computing is the study and development of systems and devices that can
recognize, interpret, process, and simulate human affects, i.e. the experience
of feelings or emotions. Over the past decade, research has shown the impact of
affective states on work performance and on team collaboration. This also
applies for software engineering that involves people in a broad range of
activities, where personality, moods, and emotions play a crucial role. For
successful software engineering projects, stakeholders need to experience
positive affect (such as trust or appreciation), to agree on display rules for
emotions, and to hold mutual commitment to the project goals. Recently,
researchers started to study the role of affective computing and affective
states in software engineering. However, contributions on this topic are
currently presented and discussed in diverse conferences and workshops. This
workshop follows on the third edition held at ICSE&nbsp;2018, towards the
consolidation of an international, sustainable forum for researchers and
practitioners interested in the role of affect in software engineering to meet,
present, and discuss their work-in-progress. Highquality contributions about
empirical studies, theoretical models, as well as tools for supporting emotion
awareness in software engineering are invited to the workshop, both from
academia and industry.

## Topics

This workshop aims at identifying and addressing challenges posed by emotion
awareness in software engineering. Topics of interest include, but are not
limited to:

*   Impact of affective states (emotions, moods, attitudes, personality traits)
    on individual and group performance, commitment and collaboration in
    software engineering
*   The role of affect in the social programmer ecosystem
*   Leveraging stakeholders’ affective feeemotidback to improve software, tools,
    and processes (e.g., sentiment analysis of users’ feedback, aspect-based
    sentiment analysis of product reviews, etc.)
*   Design, development, and evaluation of tools and datasets for supporting
    emotion awareness in software engineering
*   Reusable software frameworks, APIs, and patterns for designing and
    maintaining affect-aware systems
*   Ethnographic approaches to affect monitoring in the workplace of software
    projects
*   Psychology of programming and modelling of affective states (e.g.,
    defining/adapting psychological models of affect to software engineering,
    understanding the trigger behind emotions during developers’ activities,
    etc.)
*   Affective state detection from multimodal analysis of spontaneous
    communicative behavior such as natural language processing, use of biometric
    measurements, analysis of body posture and gesture, speech analysis
*   Affect sensing from communication artifacts (e.g., message boards, issue
    tracking, social media): techniques and tools for extracting and summarizing
    emotions in communication • Methodologies for large-scale emotion mining
*   Emotion awareness in requirements engineering, software design, and software
    management
*   Emotion awareness in software design philosophies, development practices,
    and tools
*   Emotion awareness in cross-cultural teams in global software development
*   Methodologies and standards
*   Replications of prior studies

## Types of Contributions

We invite three kinds of submissions:

*   Full papers (6&nbsp;pages) describe emotion awareness challenges, needs, novel
    approaches, and frameworks. New approaches must be evaluated with users in
    this category. Empirical evaluation papers and industrial experience reports
    are also welcome;
*   Short position papers (3-4&nbsp;pages) describe a new idea or work in progress;
*   Posters, data showcase and demo papers (1-2&nbsp;pages) summarize a research
    project, tool, technique or datasets.

Authors may use additional pages (up to 8 total) for references. All papers must
be in English and must conform, at time of submission, to the ACM formatting
instructions. Papers must be submitted electronically, in PDF
format. Submissions should be made at the following website:
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=semotion2018

Three members from the international program committee will review each
submission. Papers will be evaluated based on their originality, relevance to
the workshop, and their potential for discussion. The papers with the best
reviews will be accepted to be presented in the workshop.

All accepted papers will be distributed to workshop participants and will be
invited to be included in a workshop proceedings published in the ACM and IEEE
CS Digital Libraries. The official publication date of the workshop proceedings
is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Library. This date may
be up to two weeks prior to the first day of ICSE 2019. The official publication
date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

## Dates

*   Paper submissions: 1&nbsp;February 2019
*   Notification to authors: 1&nbsp;March 2019
*   Camera-ready copies due: 15&nbsp;March 2019
*   Workshop: 27&nbsp;May 2019 in [location](…).
