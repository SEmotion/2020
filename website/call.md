## Motivation

Affective computing is the study and development of systems and devices that can
recognize, interpret, process, and simulate human affects—i.e., the experience
of feelings or emotions. Over the past decade, research has shown the impact of
affective states on work performance and on team collaboration. This also
applies to software engineering that involves people in a broad range of
activities, where personality, moods, and emotions play a crucial role. For
successful software engineering projects, stakeholders need to experience
positive affect (such as trust or appreciation), to agree on display rules for
emotions, and to hold mutual commitment to the project goals. Recently,
researchers started to study the role of affective computing and affective
states in software engineering. However, contributions on this topic are
currently presented and discussed in diverse conferences and workshops. This
workshop follows on the third edition held at ICSE 2018, towards the
consolidation of an international, sustainable forum for researchers and
practitioners interested in the role of affect in software engineering to meet,
present, and discuss their work in progress. High-quality contributions about
empirical studies, theoretical models, as well as tools for supporting emotion
awareness in software engineering are invited to the workshop from both academia
and industry.

## Topics

Affective states play a crucial role in daily work since they might affect the
performance and outcome of both individual and group activities. Personality
traits, moods, and emotions contribute to the affective climate of a project or
an organization since affective states are experienced continuously and
communicated through direct or computer-mediated interactions. Leveraging
emotion awareness in software engineering could enhance the development
performance, quality of software, mood regulation within a project team, and
fruitful interactions with all stakeholders involved in the software engineering
domain. This workshop will identify and address challenges posed by emotion
awareness in software engineering. Topics of interest include, but are not
limited to:

*   Impact of affective states (emotions, moods, attitudes, personality traits)
    on individual and group performance, commitment and collaboration in
    software engineering
*   The role of affect in the social programmer ecosystem
*   Leveraging stakeholders affective feedback to improve software, tools, and
    processes (e.g., sentiment analysis of users feedback, aspect-based
    sentiment analysis of product reviews, etc.)
*   Design, development, and evaluation of tools and datasets for supporting
    emotion awareness in software engineering
*   Reusable software frameworks, APIs, and patterns for designing and
    maintaining affect-aware systems
*   Ethnographic approaches to affect monitoring in the workplace of software
    projects
*   Psychology of programming and modeling of affective states (e.g.,
    psychological models of affect in software engineering, understanding the
    trigger behind emotions during developers activities, etc.)
*   Affective state detection from multimodal analysis of spontaneous
    communicative behavior such as natural language processing, use of biometric
    measurements, analysis of body posture and gesture, speech analysis
*   Affect sensing from communication artifacts (e.g., message boards, issue
    tracking, social media)
*   Methodologies for large-scale emotion mining
*   Emotion awareness in requirements engineering, software design, and software
    management
*   Emotion awareness in software design philosophies, development practices,
    and tools
*   Emotion awareness in cross-cultural teams in global software development
*   Methodologies and standards
*   Replications of prior studies

## Types of Contributions

We invite four kinds of submissions:

*   Full papers (6&nbsp;pages) describe emotion awareness challenges, needs,
    novel approaches, and frameworks. New approaches must be evaluated with
    users in this category. Empirical evaluation papers and industrial
    experience reports are also welcome.
*   Short position papers (3-4&nbsp;pages) describe a new idea or work in
    progress.
*   Challenge papers (4&nbsp;pages) The challenge report describes the results
    obtained from a dataset which will be advertised on the workshop
    website. The papers should cover the following aspects: questions addressed,
    approach and tools used, results and interpretation, summary of conclusions.
*   Posters, data showcase and demo papers (1-2&nbsp;pages) summarize a research
    project, tool, technique or datasets.

Authors may use additional pages (up to 8&nbsp;total) for references.  All
papers must be in English and must conform, at time of submission, to the ICSE
formatting guidelines for Technical Research. Papers must be submitted
electronically, in PDF format. The submission site is hosted by EasyChair and
can be accessed from the workshop website.

Three members from the international program committee will review each
submission. Papers will be evaluated based on their originality, relevance to
the workshop, and their potential for discussion. The papers with the best
reviews will be accepted to be presented at the workshop. All accepted papers
will be distributed to workshop participants and will be invited to be included
in a workshop proceedings published in the ACM and IEEE CS Digital Libraries.

## Dates

*   Paper submissions: 1&nbsp;February 2019
*   Notification to authors: 1&nbsp;March 2019
*   Camera-ready copies due: 15&nbsp;March 2019
<!-- *   Workshop: 25&nbsp;May 2019 in [location](…). -->
