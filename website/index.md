## Workshop Overview

Affective computing is the study and development of systems and devices that can
recognize, interpret, process, and simulate human affects, i.e. the experience
of feelings or emotions. Over the past decade, research has shown the impact of
affective states on work performance and on team collaboration. This also
applies for software engineering that involves people in a broad range of
activities, where personality, moods, and emotions play a crucial role. For
successful software engineering projects, stakeholders need to experience
positive affect (such as trust or appreciation), to agree on display rules for
emotions, and to hold mutual commitment to the project goals.

Recently, researchers started to study the role of affective computing and
affective states in software engineering. However, contributions on this topic
are currently presented and discussed in diverse conferences and workshops. This
workshop follows on the third edition held at ICSE&nbsp;2018, towards the
consolidation of an international, sustainable forum for researchers and
practitioners interested in the role of affect in software engineering to meet,
present, and discuss their work-in-progress.

High-quality contributions about empirical studies, theoretical models, as well
as tools for supporting emotion awareness in software engineering are invited to
the workshop, both from academia and industry.
