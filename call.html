<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>Affective computing is the study and development of systems and devices that can recognize, interpret, process, and simulate human affects—i.e., the experience of feelings or emotions. Over the past decade, research has shown the impact of affective states on work performance and on team collaboration. This also applies to software engineering that involves people in a broad range of activities, where personality, moods, and emotions play a crucial role. For successful software engineering projects, stakeholders need to experience positive affect (such as trust or appreciation), to agree on display rules for emotions, and to hold mutual commitment to the project goals. Recently, researchers started to study the role of affective computing and affective states in software engineering. However, contributions on this topic are currently presented and discussed in diverse conferences and workshops. This workshop follows on the third edition held at ICSE 2018, towards the consolidation of an international, sustainable forum for researchers and practitioners interested in the role of affect in software engineering to meet, present, and discuss their work in progress. High-quality contributions about empirical studies, theoretical models, as well as tools for supporting emotion awareness in software engineering are invited to the workshop from both academia and industry.</p>
<h2 id="topics">Topics</h2>
<p>Affective states play a crucial role in daily work since they might affect the performance and outcome of both individual and group activities. Personality traits, moods, and emotions contribute to the affective climate of a project or an organization since affective states are experienced continuously and communicated through direct or computer-mediated interactions. Leveraging emotion awareness in software engineering could enhance the development performance, quality of software, mood regulation within a project team, and fruitful interactions with all stakeholders involved in the software engineering domain. This workshop will identify and address challenges posed by emotion awareness in software engineering. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Impact of affective states (emotions, moods, attitudes, personality traits) on individual and group performance, commitment and collaboration in software engineering</li>
<li>The role of affect in the social programmer ecosystem</li>
<li>Leveraging stakeholders affective feedback to improve software, tools, and processes (e.g., sentiment analysis of users feedback, aspect-based sentiment analysis of product reviews, etc.)</li>
<li>Design, development, and evaluation of tools and datasets for supporting emotion awareness in software engineering</li>
<li>Reusable software frameworks, APIs, and patterns for designing and maintaining affect-aware systems</li>
<li>Ethnographic approaches to affect monitoring in the workplace of software projects</li>
<li>Psychology of programming and modeling of affective states (e.g., psychological models of affect in software engineering, understanding the trigger behind emotions during developers activities, etc.)</li>
<li>Affective state detection from multimodal analysis of spontaneous communicative behavior such as natural language processing, use of biometric measurements, analysis of body posture and gesture, speech analysis</li>
<li>Affect sensing from communication artifacts (e.g., message boards, issue tracking, social media)</li>
<li>Methodologies for large-scale emotion mining</li>
<li>Emotion awareness in requirements engineering, software design, and software management</li>
<li>Emotion awareness in software design philosophies, development practices, and tools</li>
<li>Emotion awareness in cross-cultural teams in global software development</li>
<li>Methodologies and standards</li>
<li>Replications of prior studies</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="types-of-contributions-and-format-guidelines">Types of Contributions and Format Guidelines</h2>
<p>We invite three kinds of submissions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full papers (6 pages) describing emotion awareness challenges, needs, novel approaches, and frameworks. New approaches must be evaluated with users in this category. Empirical evaluation papers and industrial experience reports are also welcome.</li>
<li>Short papers (3-4 pages) describing new ideas, works in progress, datasets/artifacts, or tools/demos.</li>
<li>Posters (1-2 pages) summarizing research projects, demos, techniques.</li>
</ul>
<p>Artifact and demo papers may be either long or short papers depending on the level of maturity they are at. We especially encourage evaluation of systems on publicly available benchmark datasets such as the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/2901739.2903505">Jira dataset</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02300">Stack Overflow gold standard on emotions</a>, and sentiment analysis datasets.</p>
<!-- https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10664-017-9546-9#Sec7 -->
<p>Authors may use additional pages (up to 8 total) for references. All papers must be in English and must conform, at time of submission, to <a href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html">the ICSE formatting guidelines for Technical Research</a>. Papers must be submitted electronically, in PDF format. The submission site is hosted by EasyChair and can be accessed <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=semotion2019">here</a>.</p>
<p>Three members from the international program committee will review each submission. Papers will be evaluated based on their originality, relevance to the workshop, and their potential for discussion. The papers with the best reviews will be accepted to be presented at the workshop. All accepted papers will be distributed to workshop participants and will be invited to be included in a workshop proceedings published in the ACM and IEEE CS Digital Libraries.</p>
